        Args:
            client_id: When you register your application, Spotify provides you a Client ID.
            redirect_uri: The URI to redirect to after the user grants or denies permission. This URI needs to have been
                entered in the Redirect URI whitelist that you specified when you registered your application. The value
                of redirect_uri here must exactly match one of the values you entered when you registered your
                application, including upper or lowercase, terminating slashes, and such.
            state: The state can be useful for correlating requests and responses. Because your redirect_uri can be
                guessed, using a state value can increase your assurance that an incoming connection is the result of an
                authentication request. If you generate a random string, or encode the hash of some client state, such
                as a cookie, in this state variable, you can validate the response to additionally ensure that both the
                request and response originated in the same browser. This provides protection against attacks such as
                cross-site request forgery. See RFC-6749.
            scope: A space-separated list of scopes.If no scopes are specified, authorization will be granted only to
                access publicly available information: that is, only information normally visible in the Spotify
                desktop, web, and mobile players.
            show_dialog: Whether or not to force the user to approve the app again if theyâ€™ve already done so. If false
                (default), a user who has already approved the application may be automatically redirected to the URI
                specified by redirect_uri. If true, the user will not be automatically redirected and will have to
                approve the app again.
